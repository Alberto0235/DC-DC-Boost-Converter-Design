# ‚ö° DC-DC Boost Converter Design

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete documentation, **LTspice simulation files**, and analysis for a **DC-DC Boost Converter** project. Developed for a Power Electronics Laboratory course, the work focuses on the full design cycle: theoretical sizing, performance simulation, and **practical realization** on a breadboard.

The core objective was to regulate an input voltage ($V_{in}=5 \, \si{\volt}$) to a stable output voltage ($V_{o}=10 \, \si{\volt}$) across a dynamic load range, with a specific focus on:
* Achieving **acceptable efficiency** under varying loads.
* Mitigating switching noise and transients using a custom-designed **RC Snubber** circuit.

The official laboratory report detailing all calculations and results can be found below:

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation and Setup
The circuit was built and tested to validate the theoretical model and to analyze non-idealities introduced by the breadboard and component parasitics.

### Instrumentation Used
Accurate measurement and signal generation were ensured using the following equipment:


*The full laboratory setup, including the Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Bench Power Supply, and Electronic Load.*

### Circuit Assembly and Probing
The final circuit was assembled on a breadboard, paying close attention to component proximity to minimize parasitic inductance. Note the specialized probing technique used on the sensitive switching node to reduce measurement-induced interference.

## üìä Key Operational Results
The analysis focused on measuring efficiency ($E_{ff}$) as a function of output current ($I_{out}$) and verifying signal integrity.

### 1. Efficiency vs. Output Current
Efficiency analysis showed a peak at moderate load ($0.2 \, \si{\ampere}$), confirming that conduction and switching losses dominate at higher output currents ($0.9 \, \si{\ampere}$).

### 2. Signal Integrity and Snubber Efficacy
The oscilloscope capture below illustrates the key signals used for analysis. Measurements confirmed the successful operation in **Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)** and highlighted the impact of non-ideal components (diode drop, ESR).


*Oscilloscope signals: Output Voltage ($V_o$), Switching Node, Input Voltage ($V_{in}$), and MOSFET Gate Drive (Duty Cycle).*
