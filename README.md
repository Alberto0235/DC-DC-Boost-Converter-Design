# ‚ö° DC-DC Boost Converter Design

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete documentation, **LTspice simulation files**, and analysis for a **DC-DC Boost Converter** project. Developed for a Power Electronics Laboratory course, the work focuses on the full design cycle: theoretical sizing, performance simulation, and **practical realization** on a breadboard.

The core objective was to regulate an input voltage ($V_{in}=5 \, \si{\volt}$) to a stable output voltage ($V_{o}=10 \, \si{\volt}$) across a dynamic load range, with a specific focus on:
* Achieving **acceptable efficiency** under varying loads.
* Mitigating switching noise and transients using a custom-designed **RC Snubber** circuit.

## üìä Key Operational Results
The analysis focused on measuring efficiency ($E_{ff}$) as a function of output current ($I_{out}$) and verifying signal integrity.

### 1. Efficiency vs. Output Current
Efficiency analysis showed a peak at moderate load ($0.2 \, \si{\ampere}$), confirming that conduction and switching losses dominate at higher output currents ($0.9 \, \si{\ampere}$).

### Efficiency Analysis ($E_{ff}$)
Experimental data confirmed the performance goals, showing a clear dependency of efficiency on the output current:

* **Peak Efficiency:** Recorded at moderate load ($I_{out} = 0.2 \, \si{\ampere}$).
* **Losses:** Efficiency decreases at high output currents due to increased switching and conduction losses (dominated by component resistances and breadboard parasitics).
